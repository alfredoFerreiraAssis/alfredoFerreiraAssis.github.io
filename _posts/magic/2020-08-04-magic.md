Nmap shows port 22 and 80  
At port 80 I got this page and a link for login  
![port80](/assets/img/magic/magic1.png)  
and the login page  
![loginPage](/assets/img/magic/magic2.png)  
At a first moment I tried fuzz to find a register page  
But while the fuzzer was running I tried login with the classic [sql injection](https://www.sqlinjection.net/login/) bypass  and got the admin login using the credentials admin:wrongpassword' OR 'a'='a  
![loginByPass](/assets/img/magic/magic3.png)  
Logged as admin I got page of img upload  
![uploadPage](/assets/img/magic/magic4.png)  
I tried upload a shell.php but got no success  
![fail](/assets/img/magic/magic5.png)
It has to be a image file.  
I know that exiftool is a tool for image files, then I google how to use it to add a payload in a image file  
In [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html) I found a way to add a comment  
### exploit
So I downloaded a image, used exiftool  
![exftoolComment](/assets/img/magic/magic6.png)  
exiftool shell.jpg  
![comment](/assets/img/magic/magic7.png)  

Renamed it to shell.php.jpg and uploaded it  
Looking the source code I found "images" directory  
![imagesDir](/assets/img/magic/magic8.png)  
and fuzzed it to find "uploads" directory  
![uploadsDir](/assets/img/magic/magic9.png)  
Then I used firefox to find my shell  
![shell](/assets/img/magic/magic10.png)  
There is my RCE  
Time to get my reverse shell using [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)'s cheat  
started my nc listener and used pentestmonkey's python payload (changed python to python3 and the lhost and lport)  
I'm in  
![shell](/assets/img/magic/magic11.png)  
Now I got to escalate privilege to user and then to root  
### user 
Here there is a file db.php5... 
![db](/assets/img/magic/magic12.png)  
Let's see what it got  
![theseus](assets/img/magic/magic13.png)  
In /etc/passwd I found user theseus, perhaps his pass is the same of db  
![passFail](/assets/img/magic/magic14.png)  
Failure =(  
So the way is try to get it from db  
mysqldump --password=iamkingtheseus -u theseus -X  
Now I got the pass  
![pass](/assets/img/magic/magic15.png)  
# PRIV ESC  
### linpeas  
Now that I'm in user point I download linpeas  
For that I open a server in my parrot machine with python  
and download linpeas with theseus  

![pythonServer](/assets/img/magic/magic16.png)  
and "chmod +x linpeas.sh;./linpeas.sh"  

linpeas shows me that /bin/sysinfo belongs to root and I can and read and execute it  
![linpeas](/assets/img/magic/magic17.png)    
### sysinfo  
![sysinfo](/assets/img/magic/magic18.png)  
It's working  
I created a fake [lshw](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/lshw.1.html) file with a payload  
The same payload from pentesmonkey, but with a different lport  
![payload](/assets/img/magic/magic19.png)  
Downloaded it with theseus, just like linpeas...
Exported the path  
>export PATH=/tmp/41fr3d0:$PATH export PATH=/tmp/41fr3d0:$PATH  
![export](/assets/img/magic/magic20.png)  
chmod 755 lshw  
Started my nc and executed sysinfo  
![root](/assets/img/magic/magic21.png)
