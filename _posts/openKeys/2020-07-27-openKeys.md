Time to Fuzz  
### ffuf  
ffuf -u http://10.10.10.199/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/raft-large-directories.txt  

ffuf gives-me some directories

Opening "includes" there is 2 files, opening the ".swp" I got a user, jennifer, and a rabbit hole(../auth\_helpers/check\_auth), that I spent too much time trying to do reverse engineering to extract anything usefull...  

Google for openbsd exploits I found [this one](https://www.qualys.com/2019/12/04/cve-2019-19521/authentication-vulnerabilities-openbsd.txt)  

### Exploitation  

It says that using credentials "-schallenge:passwd" the authentication is automatically sucessfull  
I used it, but didn't found anything, so I intercepted the request using Burp Suite  and added the cookie ";username=jennifer"

### Burp Suite

Server response: "I'm in"  
![id\_rsa](/assets/img/openKeys/id.png)  

I copied the private key to a file and "chmod 600 jennifer\_rsa; ssh -i jennifer\_rsa jennifer@10.10.10.199"

# Priv Esc
The [link](https://www.qualys.com/2019/12/04/cve-2019-19521/authentication-vulnerabilities-openbsd.txt) above also has a the CVE-2019-19520, used to privilege escalation  

I copied it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcoles/local-exploits/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot)  
and pasted in a archive in openbsd, "chmod +x" in the archive, executed it and got the pass to root
