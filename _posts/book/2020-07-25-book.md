<center>Opening the port 80 I got this</center>  
# ![book1](/assets/img/book/book1.png)
  
<center>After register I found the admin  email: admin@book.htb</center>  
# ![book2](/assets/img/book/book3.png)
  
<center>At first I didn't know what to do with this</center>  
<center>Until I back to home page, look the source and find this</center>  
# ![book3](/assets/img/book/book2.png)  
  
### <center>SQL Truncation</center>
  
<p align="center">Using <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/sql-truncation-attack/">SQL truncation</a> with Burp Suite I tested "name" and "email" fields with more characters</p>  
  
# ![book4](/assets/img/book/book4.png)  
  
<center>Logged in with the credentials admin@book.htb qwerty</center>  
  
# ![book5](/assets/img/book/book5.png)  
  
<p align="center">Using <a href="https://www.noob.ninja/2017/11/local-file-read-via-xss-in-dynamically.html">this</a> as reference I found a way in</p>  
  
### Exploit  
  
<center>Loged as user again I uploaded a pdf with the fields "author" and "book title" filled with this script (missing script tags) </center>  

  
*****
  
<center>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();</center>  
  
*****  
  
  
<center>Downloading the pdf at http://10.10.10.176/admin/collections.php?type=collections I got the /etc/passwd</center>  

# ![book6](/assets/img/book/book6.png)  
  
<center>If I was runnin to get user blood next step would be "file:///home/reader/user.txt"</center>  
  
<center>Before get the id\_rsa from reader I tried root, perhaps...</center>  
  
<center>Now I know that there is a user called reader, I chnged the script part "///etc/passwd" to "/home/reader/.ssh/id\_rsa and uploaded a new pdf, downloaded it again and a got the id\_rsa from user reader</center>  
  
<center>Copy that to another file called id\_rsa and "chmod 600 id\_rsa"</center>  
  
# ![book7](/assets/img/book/book7.png)  
  
<center>Now just "ssh -i id\_rsa reader@10.10.10.176" and smile</center>  
  
# ![book8](/assets/img/book/book8.png)</center>
  
  
# Privilege Escalation  
  
  
<center>After enumerate almost everything and don't find nothing</center>  
<p align="center">I used <a href="https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy.git">pspy</a> and find root process</p>  
<center>scp -i id\_rsa pspy64s reader@10.10.10.176</center>  
  
  
<center>pspy give me this process logrotate /usr/sbin/logrotate -f /root/log.cfg</center>  
  
# ![book9](/assets/img/book/book9.png)  
  
<p align="center">Search logrotate exploit in google and found <a href="https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten">this</a> on github</p>  
<center>Cloned the repository and uploaded it with scp command</center>  
<center>Unziped the archive and compiled the logrotten.c with gcc</center>  
  
<center>gcc -o logrotten logrotten.c</center>  
  
<center>Created the payload  and executed logrotten</center>  
  
# ![book10](/assets/img/book/book10.png)  
  
<center>Now just cat /tmp/id\_rsa to another file and ssh to root</center>  
  
  
# ![book11](/assets/img/book/book11.png)  
# ![book12](/assets/img/book/book12.png)
